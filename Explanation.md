The code calculates an array where each element at index i is the product of all elements in the input array except the element at i. 
It does this in linear time without division. First, it computes prefix products for each index, which are the products of all elements before that index. 
Then, it iterates from right to left, using a running suffix product to complete the result. 
The result for each index is the product of the prefix product and the suffix product. The algorithm runs in 
O(n) time and uses O(n) space.
